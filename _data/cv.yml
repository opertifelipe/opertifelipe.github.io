      description:
        - Data Scientist in Santander DataLab. Data Lab is an innovative area whose aim is to develop large cross-areas end-to-end projects. Data Lab works as a consultancy society within the bank. In the lab, the interaction between product owners, data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers is strongly encouraged. My responsibilities there are from one side to develop machine learning models (as data scientist consultant). Due to the heterogeneity sof the projects, also the applied machine learning and deep learning models are heterogeneous. On the other side, I am also responsible for checking the entire pipeline (from the ETL, the development of the models, and finally the deployment).

      description:
        - Data scientist at Santander Bank in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). My position there was of senior data scientist and my responsibility was the development of machine learning models for different purposes (propensity and churn models for different products among others). Such models were typically machine learning supervised algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks as well as unsupervised algorithms such as hierarchical, k-means, and DBSCAN. Furthermore, we worked with NLP algorithms for sentimental analysis of reclamations data.
