I am a Full Stack Data Scientist with extensive expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, and Generative AI. Holding a Ph.D. in Physics of Complex Systems, my research focused on computational analysis in socio-economic sciences. I specialize in designing, developing, and deploying advanced AI solutions that drive measurable business outcomes.

Proficient in Azure and AWS cloud services, I utilize technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and FastAPI to build scalable and efficient applications. My skill set includes natural language processing, generative AI, deep learning, machine learning, software engineering, and data analysis.

I have worked across diverse domains such as insurance, banking, technology, and retail. Leading end-to-end projects, I collaborate with teams of data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. I am committed to delivering innovative AI solutions and eager to partner with organizations that share a passion for artificial intelligence and technology.
